## What Is The Iterator Design Pattern?

* The Iterator Design Pattern provides a uniform way to access
  different collections of objects

* For example an Array, ArrayList, and Hashtable of objects, an "iterator"
  is made for each of these collections and treats them the same way

* This provides a uniform way to cycle through the different collections

* Polymorphic code can be written because each collection of objects
  implements the same interface
