## What Is The Facade Design Pattern?

- A design pattern used to create a simplified interface that
  performs many other actions behind the scenes

- For Example:
  Withrawing money from a bank account
  - Checks if the checking account is valid
  - Check if the security code is valid
  - Check if the funds are available
  - Make changes accordingly


## Implementation
* Use seperation of concerns to create
  multiple classes that do one thing

* A class that has references to all the
  classes needed to complete it's task
