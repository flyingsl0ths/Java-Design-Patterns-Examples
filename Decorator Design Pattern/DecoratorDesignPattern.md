## What Is The Decorator Design Pattern?

* A design patter where an object is 
  **decorated** with many other objects at _runtime_ to produce an object

* A design pattern that allows you to modify an object dynamically

* Used when you want the capabilities of inheritance with
  subclasses, but need the functionality added at runtime

* It is more flexible than inheritance

* Simplifies code, due to adding functionality using many simple
  classes

* Rather than rewrite old code you can extend new code
