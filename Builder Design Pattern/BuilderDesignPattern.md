## What Is The Builder Pattern?

* _The Abstract Factory Pattern but instead of producing an object
  that can take on the form of many objects we produce an object made up of many objects_

* A design pattern used to create objects made from a 
  collection of other objects
  * Used to build an object made up of parts from other objects
  * Used to make the creation of these parts independent of
    the main object
  * Used to hide the creation of the part from the client so both
    aren't dependent
  * The builder knows the specifics and nobody else
